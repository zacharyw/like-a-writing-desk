<p>
I'm a software developer living in Lexington, KY. I am currently employed by, and solve problems for, <a href="https://www.zillowgroup.com/">Zillow Group</a>, where I work on the <a href="https://www.nakedapartments.com/">Naked Apartments</a> project. I graduated from the University of Kentucky summa cum laude in 2010, with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics.

<p>
<strong>Like a Writing Desk</strong> is my headspace on the web. It's a catch-all for thoughts, theories, ramblings, and information that I think would be useful to others, or just worth writing down. In the end, they may be neither, but at least I have a record. It's not intended to be a software development blog, but since it's what I do I'm sure a decent number of posts will be about that.

<h2>Personal Life</h2>

<p>
In my free time I <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11680501-zachary">read</a>, <a href="https://www.fitocracy.com/profile/pragmaticzach/">lift weights</a>, <a href="https://github.com/zacharyw">write more software</a>, <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/valabrax/">play video games</a>, and <a href="http://www.howtobrew.coffee/">drink coffee</a>. I also spend a decent amount of my free time wishing I had more time, because there's not quite enough in a day for all of those things.
</p>

<h2>Technology</h2>

<p>
  I have worked as a software developer for over 7 years, and picked up quite a few technologies along the way, both on and off the job. The most important thing I've learned, though, is how to learn. I enjoy picking up and tinkering with new tools and languages. 
</p>

<p>
  My favorite tools to use for web development are Ruby on Rails and jQuery, though recently I've been experimenting with front end frameworks like AngularJS and React.js. In each new personal project I build, I like to incorporate a new technology, for better or for worse. It slows me down a bit, but also keeps me up to date and constantly learning.
</p>

<p>
  In terms of every day dev utilities, I use Linux, OSX, IntelliJ IDEA/RubyMine, and Git.

<h3>What does 'Like a Writing Desk' mean?</h3>

  <p>
    "Mad Hatter: "Why is a raven like a writing-desk?"<br>
    "Have you guessed the riddle yet?" the Hatter said, turning to Alice again.<br>
    "No, I give it up," Alice replied: "What's the answer?"<br>
    "I haven't the slightest idea," said the Hatter."<br>
